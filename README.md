This project focuses on predicting car prices using machine learning algorithms. Given a dataset containing various features of cars, such as brand, model, mileage, year of manufacture, and condition, the model aims to estimate the car's value with high accuracy.

This project is beneficial for:

Buyers who want to know the fair price of a used car.
Sellers & Dealerships who need insights on pricing strategies.
Automobile Industry Analysts who analyze market trends.

Project Overview
The Car Price Prediction project follows a data-driven approach using machine learning techniques. The workflow includes:

1️ Data Collection & Preprocessing
The dataset used consists of attributes like car brand, model, mileage, fuel type, year, and location.
Missing values are handled through imputation techniques.
Feature engineering is applied to enhance prediction accuracy.
Categorical variables are encoded for use in machine learning models.
2️ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Visualizations using Matplotlib & Seaborn to understand data trends.
Correlation analysis to identify features most affecting car prices.
Outlier detection to remove incorrect or extreme values.
3️ Model Selection & Training
Several regression algorithms are used to train the model, including:
* Linear Regression – Simple, interpretable model
* Decision Trees – Captures non-linear relationships
* Random Forest – Reduces overfitting, improves accuracy
* Gradient Boosting – Enhances performance using boosting techniques

4️ Model Evaluation & Optimization
The models are evaluated using key performance metrics:

Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
R² Score (Coefficient of Determination)
Hyperparameter tuning (Grid Search & Random Search) is performed to improve accuracy.

5️ Predictions & Deployment
The final trained model predicts car prices based on user input.
The model can be deployed using Flask or FastAPI for real-world applications.
